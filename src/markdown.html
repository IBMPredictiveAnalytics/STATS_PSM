<h2>Details</h2>
<p><strong>GROUP</strong> specifies the
  variable that defines whether a record is in the case or control
  group. A variable value of 1 indicates a case, and a value of
  0 indicates a control. </p> 
  
  <p class="bullet">• Any other value causes the case to be
  ignored.</p>

<p><strong>BY</strong> specifies the variables
  to be used in the logistic regression to model case/control
  membership.  Any categorical predictors are automatically
  treated as factors, so there is no need to create sets of
  dummy variables for them.</p>


<p><strong>PROPENSITY </strong>
Specify a name for the variable to hold the score (propensity) from
  the logistic regression. This variable will be used for
  matching.</p>

  <p class="bullet">• The variable name must not already be in
  use.</p>


<strong>FUZZ</strong> specifie the
  tolerance for the score in matching cases and controls. A control
  is eligible to match a case if the absolute value of the
  difference in the propensity scores is less than or equal to this
  value. A value of 0 means exact matches only while a value of 1
  means any control would match any case, since these are probabilities. 
  Smaller values produce
  closer matches but may increase the number of unmatched
  cases.</p>
  
  
<strong>SUPPLIERID</strong> specifies a case
  identifier variable. The Id value for the matched control
  will be stored with each case record.  The id values should, of course,
 be unique.</p>
 
<strong>NEWDEMANDERIDVAR</strong> specifies
  a name for the variable that will hold the id of the selected
  control record. If a match cannot be produced, the variable value
  will be system missing.</p>
  <p class="bullet">• The variable name must not already be in
  use.</p>
  
<p><strong>OUTPUTDS</strong> specufies a name for the dataset to be created. The dataset will hold all the
  cases and the controls that were matched with them.</p>

  <p class="bullet">• The dataset name must not already be in
  use.</p>

  <p class="bullet">• The output is a dataset, not a permanent
  file. You must save the dataset to create an actual file.</p>
  
<p><strong>USEDCONTROLSDS</strong> optionally specifies a name for
a dataset to be created that 
will hold all the
  control cases that were actually matched with the cases. </p>

  <p class="bullet">• The dataset name must not already be in
  use.</p>
  
    <p class="bullet">• The output is a dataset, not a permanent
  file.</p>
  
<h2>Options</h2>

<p><strong>DRAWPOOLSIZE</strong> optionally specifies a variable name to record the size
  of the control pool, i.e., the number of eligible cases, for each
  case record. This is the number of controls that meet the
  matching criteria after matches for previous case records have
  been removed, if sampling without replacement.</p>

  <p class="bullet">• The variable name must not already be in
  use</p>
  
<p><strong>SAMPLEWITHREPLACEMENT</strong> specifies whether control cases are
  drawn with or without replacement.</p> 

<p><strong>EXACTPRIORITY</strong>   specifies whether the matching algorithm tries first for
  an exact match before trying for a fuzzy match.</p>
  
<p><strong>MINIMIZEMEMORY</strong>  specifies whether to maximize performance in selecting matches -
  maximum speed and minimum memory usage. For large datasets this
  value should be YES. When it is used, there is a slightly
  greater chance that a case will not find be matched with a
  control.</p>
  
  <p class="bullet">• You cannot specify both EXACTPRIORITY and
  MINIMIZEMEMORY.</p>
  
<p><strong>SHUFFLE</strong> specifies whether to randomize case order when drawing
  matches Specify YES to draw matches for the case records in
  random order. Otherwise, the case records are processed in the
  order in which they occur in the file. This could result in fewer
  controls to select from later in the file. If the case records
  have a systematic order, processing in file order could introduce
  some bias.</p>

<p><strong>SEED</strong> Specify a starting seed if you want
  to be able to reproduce the matches exactly on a future run with
  the same data. This seed is not related
  to the general SPSS Statistics random number seed.</p>
